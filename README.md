## First exercise is from the course that I'm taking on Machine Learning and Data Science. The aim of this task is to train a model using Linear Regression that will predict age of possum based on physical features like skull weight and so on. Then I used two regularization method: Lasso and Ridge and I compared it in the model I've trained using different penalty scores.
